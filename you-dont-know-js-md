Things to know about Slalom's JS/React interview:

- how the "this" variable works,
-  Objects,
- Object prototypes,
- Object functions,
- arrow functions
- (and how "this" is handled in
 arrow functions),
- the 3 functional array functions: ( filter(), map(), and reduce() ),
- Promises
- the difference between call() function and apply() function.
```The difference is that apply lets you invoke the function with arguments as an array;
  - call requires the parameters be listed explicitly. A useful mnemonic is "A for array and C for comma."```
