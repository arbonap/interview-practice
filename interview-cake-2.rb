# You have an array of integers, and for each index you want to find the product of every integer except the integer at that index.
# Write a function get_products_of_all_ints_except_at_index() that takes an array of integers and returns an array of the products.

def get_products_of_all_ints_except_at_index(ary)
  ary.each_with_index do |num, i|
